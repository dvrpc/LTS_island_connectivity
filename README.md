## TODO

:white_check_mark: import data scripts

:white_check_mark: generate islands

:white_check_mark: generate blobs

:white_check_mark: grab census data (block level), parse percentage overlap

:black_square_button: add clear button to webmap

:black_square_button: make API , hook to webmap

:black_square_button: update how crashes are pulled (setup PA/NJ)

:black_square_button: change census to planbelt-census tool rather than pulling decenial from pg

optional/thought: convert analyze_connections to class , so each new study segment is an instantiated class and you can store different segment info
